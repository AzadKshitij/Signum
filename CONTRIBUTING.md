## Contributing with coding
Please feel free to contribute! I am always looking for ways to improve the editor. Signum uses Godot version 3.2.1

1. Download the Godot Engine here
2. Download the contents of the repository
3. Make your own additions! **_MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE THE GLES2 RENDERER_**

Make sure to write clean code with specific comments describing most things.
